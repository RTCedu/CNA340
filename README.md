# Project Title

This is a homework assignment for CNE 310 IT Project Management. When I execute this code it will draw a square and a triangle.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide the turtles it introduces in Python on your local machine for experimenting how to draw some squares and triangles.

### Prerequisites

A herd of turtle requires Python to run, with The commands below will form some figures in some shapes and colors.

```

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command

tess.forward(80)                 
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(80)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(80)
tess.left(120)

```

```

Add any additional ways to run the program below

```
alex.forward(50)                 # make alex draw a square
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)




```
