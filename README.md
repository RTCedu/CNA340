# Number to Letter Grade

This code takes a number between 0-100 and determines a letter grade for a student.

## Getting Started

These instructions will run this code for translating number grades to letter grades with the letterGrade.py script.

### Prerequisites

letterGrade.py requires Python 3 to run. You can install Python 3 by following the link below.

```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

## Running

Once installed you can run the program with the following command

```
python3 letterGrade.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter a number between 0 and 100, if you enter a number below 0 or above 100 you will be prompted again to enter a number between 0 and 100.

## Thanks

Thank you for checking out my code! I hope you enjoy it! I couldn't have done it without the wonderful instructors in the CNE program at Renton Technical College.
