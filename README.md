# Mad Lib Fork Project  

This is a program called Mad Lib which allows user to respond to program prompts by entering requested information. The users will enter numbers, nouns, pro-nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. For example, the program will prompt the user to enter a “noun” after which another prompt will appear to enter another word. Once all requested the program will stop. At the end of the exercise, the program will reveal the completed story which includes all the words and numbers entered by the user.
